Description:

You probably know the 42 number as "The answer to life, the 
universe and everything" according to Douglas Adams' "The 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". For Freud, the answer was 
quite different.

In the society he lived in, people-women in particular- had to 
repress their sexual needs and desires. This was simply how the 
society was at the time. Freud then wanted to study the 
illnesses created by this, and so he digged to the root of 
their desires. This led to some of the most important 
psychoanalytic theories to this day, Freud being the father of 
psychoanalysis.

Now, basically, when a person hears about Freud, s/he hears 
"sex" because for Freud, everything was basically related to, 
and explained by sex.

In this kata, the toFreud() function will take a string as its 
argument, and return a string with every word replaced by the 
explanation to everything, according to Freud. Note that an 
empty string, or no arguments, should result in the ouput being 
""(empty string).

// Solution 1
function toFreud(string) {
    return string.replace(/\w+/g,"sex");
}

// Solution 2
function toFreud(string) {
    if(string === ''){
        return string;
    }
    result = string.split(' ');
    for(let i=0; i < result.length; i++){
      result[i] = 'sex';
    }
    return result.join(' ');
}

// Solution 3
function toFreud(string) {  
    if(string === ''){
      return string;
    }
    let arr = string.split(' ')
    let result = []  
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        result.push('sex')  
    }  
    return result.join(' ')
