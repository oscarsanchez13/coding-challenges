Description:

An ATM has banknotes of nominal values 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 
500 dollars. You can consider that there is a large enough 
supply of each of these banknotes.

You have to write the ATM's function that determines the 
minimal number of banknotes needed to honor a withdrawal of 
n dollars, with 1 <= n <= 1500.

Return that number, or -1 if it is impossible.
