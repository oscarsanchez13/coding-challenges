/*
Description:

Create a function that takes a string as a parameter and does 
the following, in this order:

1. Replaces every letter with the letter following it in the 
    alphabet (see note below)

2. Makes any vowels capital

3. Makes any consonants lower case

Note:

the alphabet should wrap around, so Z becomes A
in this kata, y isn't considered as a vowel.
So, for example the string "Cat30" would return "dbU30" 
(Cat30 --> Dbu30 --> dbU30)
